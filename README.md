## System Features
The results in the paper were generated using the following:
- Operating systems: macOS 12.2.1, Windows 10 Enterprise.
- Software: Matlab R2019a, Stata 17.
- Add-ons. Matlab: financial toolboxes. Stata: scheme-modern, xtcsd, xtscc.ado*.
- Restricted data sources: Bloomberg, Datastream.
- Expected running time. Data reading: 30 mins. ATSM estimation: 6 hrs. Local projections: 2 hrs.

\* In the file xtscc.ado, comment out section `Check if dataset's timevar is regularly spaced` (lines 74-83) because `tab timevar` gives the error `too many variables`. Type `which xtscc` in Stata to find the location of the xtscc.ado file.

## Instructions for Replication
Execute the Docs/Paper/paper.tex and Docs/Paper/online.tex files to generate the PDF version of the manuscript and the online appendix.

The contents of several original data files in the Data/Raw folder cannot be shared due to licensing rights but the Data/MetadataGuide.docx file documents the steps to access the data sources. In case the user has access to the data sources, simply execute the Codes/Pre-Analysis/read_data.m file to read the original data files and generate the analysis data files.

The Codes/Analysis/ts_analysis.m and Codes/Analysis/spillovers.do files replicate the figures and tables in the paper and the online appendix. Comments in those codes indicate the lines that generate each figure and table.

Below are details to facilitate following the workflow of the codes.

In the Pre-Analysis folder, read_data.m -> generates dataset_daily (approx. runtime: 30 min)
	variable types in header_daily: RHO, LCNOM, LCSYNT, LCSPRD, CIPDEV, FCSPRD

In the Analysis folder, ts_analysis.m -> generates structure with data in fields (approx. runtime: 2 hrs)
- daily2dymy		-> extract monthly data
- add_macroNsvys	-> add macro and survey data
- append_svys2ylds	-> combine yield and survey data
- atsm_estimation 	-> estimate model w/ and w/o survey data, nominal & synthetic YCs
- se_components		-> compute standard errors using the delta method
- (post-estimation)	-> assess_fit, add_vars, ts_plots, ts_correlations, ts_pca
- atsm_daily		-> estimate model w/ daily data
- construct_panel 	-> construct panel dataset

auxiliary m-files: read_macrovars, read_kw

'dataset_daily' contains yield curves (LC, FC, US), forward premiums, spreads (LC, FC, LC-US) for different maturities with DAILY frequency. All series run top-down old-new, series were appended to the RIGHT. Series are identified with a filter over header_daily

'dataset_monthly' contains synthetic LC yield curves, expected short rates, term premia, LCCS for different maturities with MONTHLY frequency. Series run top-down old-new, series were appended BELOW (since series start at different times). Series are identified with a filter over header_monthly

### Data Files
Some data files are stored outside the main folder due to their large sizes. Before running the codes, define where those large datasets will be stored in your computer by updating the paths in the respective codes (read_data.m, ts_analysis.m, spillovers.do).
- The large data files are: struct_datady_cells.mat, struct_datady_S.mat, struct_datamy_S.mat, dataspillovers1.dta, dataspillovers2.dta.
- Most data in Matlab are stored in a structure array of countries with different fields; the information in key fields is stored as a timetable (a Matlab data type).
