%
% Estimates the model with the following setup:
%  1. Optimize over (lamQ, Sigma_cP).
%  2. lamQ is assumed to be real, parameterized by the difference to maintain order.
%  3. Sigma_cP parameterized by cholesky factorization in optimization
%  4. Take randomized lamQ as initial seeds.  See lines 107-108 for the randomization
%  5. always use OLS estimate of Sigma_cP to start (see Joslin, Singleton, Le)
%  6. Generate 50 random seeds and take best to start (avoid really bad areas -- no point in looking here)
%  7. (kinfQ, sigma_e, K0P, K1P) are all concentrated out of the likelihood function.  See JSZ and JLS.
%  8. Run fmincon and repeat 3 times.  Repeating re-sets the iteratively computed Hessian.

% INPUTS:
% W       : N*J,  weights for the yield portfolios measured without error
% yields  : T*J,  annualized zero coupon yields
% mats    : 1*J,  maturities, in years 
% dt      : scalar, time in years for each period
% VERBOSE : boolean, true prints more output
%
% OUTPUTS:
% K0Q_X      : N*1,      normalized latent-model matrix 
% K1Q_X      : N*N,      normalized latent-model matrix 
% Sigma_cP   : N*N,      positive definite matrix that is the covariance of innovations to cP
% K0P_cP     : N*1,      
% K1P_cP     : N*N,      
% sigma_e    : scalar,   standard error of yield observation errors (errors are i.i.d)
%
% Compute likelihood conditioned on first observation!
%
% llk        : T*1       time series of -log likelihoods (includes 2-pi constants)
% AcP        : 1*J       yt = AcP' + BcP'*Xt  (yt is J*1 vector)
% BcP        : N*J       AcP, BcP satisfy internal consistency condition that AcP*W' = 0, BcP*W' = I_N
% AX         : 1*J       yt = AX' + BX'*Xt  
% BX         : N*J       Xt is the 'jordan-normalized' latent state
%
%
% The model takes the form:
%   r(t) = rho0_cP + rho1_cP'*cPt
%        = rinfQ + 1'*Xt  (Xt is the 'jordan-normalized' state
%        = 1 period discount rate (annualized)
%
% Under Q:
%   X(t+1) - X(t)   = K0Q_X  + K1Q_X*X(t)  + eps_X(t+1),   cov(eps_X(t+1)) = Sigma_X
%   cP(t+1) - cP(t) = K0Q_cP + K1Q_cP*X(t) + eps_cP(t+1),  cov(eps_cP(t+1)) = Sigma_cP
%   where Sigma_X is chosen to match Sigma_cP 
% and K0Q_X(m1) = kinfQ where m1 is the multiplicity of the highest eigenvalue (typically 1)
%
% Under P:
%   cP(t+1) - cP(t) = K0P_cP + K1P_cP*X(t) + eps_cP(t+1),  cov(eps_cP(t+1)) = Sigma_cP
%
% Model yields are given by:
%   yt^m = AcP' + BcP'*cPt  (J*1)
% And observed yields are given by:
%  yt^o = yt^m + epsilon_e(t)
% where V*epsilon_e~N(0,sigma_e^2 I_(J-N))
% and V is an (J-N)*J matrix which projects onto the span orthogonal to the
% row span of W.  This means errors are orthogonal to cPt and cPt^o = cPt^m.
