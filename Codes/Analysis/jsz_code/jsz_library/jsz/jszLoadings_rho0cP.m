% This gives a slight variant of the JSZ normalization.
% 
% There is one "intercept" parameter governing the risk-neutral
% distribution.  This can be the long run mean of the short rate under Q
% (assuming stationarity) or the drift of the most persistent factor.
%
% Here we parameterize the intercept parameter through the relationship:
%  r_t = rho0_cP + rho1_cP.Xt
% 
% Given a fixed set of eigenvalues for K1Q, there is a one-to-one
% mapping between rho0_cP and kinf.
%
%
% Inputs:
%   mats       : 1*J,      maturities in years
%   dt         : scalar,   length of period in years
%   W          : N*J,      vector of portfolio weights to fit without error.
%   K1Q_X      : N*N
%   rho0_cP    : scalar,   the short rate will be rt = rho0_cP + rho1_cP.cP_t
%   Sigma_cP, Sigma_X : N*N  covariance of innovations. PROVIDE ONE OR THE OTHER
%
% Returns:
%   AcP : 1*J

%   AX  : 1*J

% 1. Compute the loadings for the normalized model:

%     and r(t) = 1.X(t)  
%     where r(t) is the annualized short rate, (i.e. price of 1-period zero coupon bond at time t is exp(-r(t)*dt))
%    If Sigma_X is not provided, it is solved for so that Sigma_cP (below) is matched.
